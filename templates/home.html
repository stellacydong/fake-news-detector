           While our dataset and model was quite accurate, we still ran into some problems. For instance, our dataset was unfortunately quite limited due to the lack of availability of data near 2021. Instead, we had to focus our data on news and events which occurred from 2015 to 2018. As a result, later news from years such as 2020 might not be as accurate as news from 2016. Additionally, another problem with our model could be overfitting. Either our dataset was very good at distinguishing the difference between real and fake news or our model is working very well.

Additionally, the dates of each article varied between March 2015 - February 2018. In total,&nbsp;<b>51,233 news articles</b> were incorporated into our final product, 26,645 of which were fake news, while 24,588 were real news.

It attempts to maximize the distance between the division and the closest data points, also known as support vectors. These support vectors "guide" the hyper plane to divide the two populations as good as possible. In cases where the data is not linearly divided, we can use a kernel to project the data onto a higher dimension. In this new dimension, we can draw a new hyper plane that divides the populations.<br>

It uses the cell state, the previous output AND the new input to determine its value. The cell state is modified through a forget gate and an input gate. The forget gate tells the cell state what to forget and what to keep, while the input gate adds new information from the input. This is particularly useful when analyzing long sentences. A normal RNN might forget what happened at the beginning of the sentence, while LSTM can use the entire sentence as contex to calculate its output.</p>

                        <br>We also used recall to determine how often true is predicted when the result is actually true. To calculate the recall rate, we divided the true positive values by the total number of actual true values. The recall rate of our testing set was around 0.9893469198703103.<br>
                        <br>Lastly, we used precision to measure how often a predicted true value is actually correct. To calculate precision, we divided all the true positive values by the number of predicted true values.&nbsp; For our testing set, the precision was 0.9893469198703103.<br>
                        <br>Overall, our training model was pretty accurate because we were able to get around 99% of accuracy across all tests and calculations.

                      While our dataset and model was quite accurate, we still ran into some problems. For instance, our dataset was unfortunately quite limited due to the lack of availability of data near 2021. Instead, we had to focus our data on news and events which occurred from 2015 to 2018. As a result, later news from years such as 2020 might not be as accurate as news from 2016. Additionally, another problem with our model could be overfitting. Either our dataset was very good at distinguishing the difference between real and fake news or our model is working very well.<br><br>

My team communicated frequently and bounced ideas off of each other which was monumental in helping us overcome hitches in the process of designing our website and navigating multiple CoCalc platforms.

However, the lectures and small group teachings really helped out in learning the fundamentals of both Python and AI. I even enjoyed our final product, the fake news detector, because I believe that it is a key issue which must be addressed. Some downsides of the camp, in my opinion, were that the fast pace can be a bit challenging at times and lectures were sometimes a bit too long. Aside from that, I loved AI Camp and I would recommend it for anyone trying to learn Python and AI."</p>
